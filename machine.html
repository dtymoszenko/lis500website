    <h3>Reflections On Our Project & Unmasking AI by Joy Bolumawani</h3>
    <p class="heroText">
      As we began working on this project, we made sure to have various themes
      from the text titled Unmasking AI: My Mission to Protect What is Human in
      a World of Machines by Dr. Joy Buolamwini in mind. Dr. Joy Buolamwini’s
      story taught us about how technology interacts with our fragile social
      structures and ideals. Her work emphasized a rejection of the norm and a
      willingness to question the status quo. In beginning this project, we made
      sure to adhere to Dr Buolamwini’s philosophy and label our data based on
      what we believed objectively represented each category.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="heroText">
      The extra attention we paid to making sure that every data input we gave
      the machine was as impartial and accurate as possible is the result of the
      awareness we gained by reading Dr Buolamwini’s work. We know that if the
      data that is being given to a machine carries implicit biases, the machine
      will inherit those same biases. This can have palpable negative impacts on
      certain groups who were underrepresented in the data used to train the
      machine. In Unmasking AI, Dr Buolamwini discovered that her face was not
      being recognized by facial recognition technology because the technology
      had been trained using data in which her demographic was underrepresented.
      She referred to this phenomenon as the coded gaze, defined as “The
      preferences of those who have the power to choose what subjects to focus
      on.” (Buolamwini 51)
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="heroText">
      In our project we acted as the masters of our own coded gaze. We held the
      sole power to determine what qualified as a certain amount of fingers just
      like the so-called coded gaze has the power to determine what data sets
      inform machine learning models. The power we have to determine what data
      is used to inform our machine is not comparable to the power of others who
      are labeling data for more important sets of information. Despite the
      differences in the importance of the data, the principle laid out by Dr
      Buolamwini still holds true. No matter how insignificant the data being
      labeled is, it is never neutral because, as Dr Buolamwini says,
      “Classification systems do not come out of nowhere.” (Buolamwini 81)
    </p>

    <br />
    <p class="heroText">
      As we began to test our machine by holding up different numbers of
      fingers, we saw the model respond with varying levels of success. When we
      gave the machine a specific input that it was prepared for, holding up a
      specific number of fingers, we experienced a true positive. However when
      we showed the machine other parts of our arms it was still required to
      classify the images. This led to significant decreases in accuracy. We had
      created a system where only four categories existed, therefore the machine
      could only use four labels. Dr Buolamwini detailed an opposite phenomenon
      in Unmasking AI. If the facial recognition technology was only trained on
      data that classified certain faces, when it was presented with a face it
      did not recognize it would fail to classify it all together, rather than
      classifying it as a false face.

    <h3>Project Statement</h3>
    <p class="heroText">
      The idea that we decided we wanted to teach a Teachable Machine was how
      many numbers we were holding up with our fingers. We thought that this was
      a great idea because anyone who had their webcam on would be able to
      quickly change the number of fingers they are holding up and test if our
      algorithm was working properly or not. Instead of requiring props or other
      images, we thought it would be pretty easy for anyone to test out at any
      time.
    </p>
    <br />

      alt="Picture of classes used to train machine learning program"
    />

    <p class="heroText">
      To overview our project, we created a Teachable Machine project which
      recognizes how many fingers are held up on one hand. Our model allows a
      user to hold up fingers in the range of 0 to 3, and the machine will
      quickly recognize how many fingers you are displaying. We tried to allow
      this to occur from a variance of ranges, but found that the model was most
      accurate when fingers are displayed closer to the webcam.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="heroText">
      Originally, we wanted to do 0-5 fingers for a total of 6 classes for 0-5
      fingers being held up. We initially loaded up our classes by putting 1000
      pictures in each class. Once we had all of the pictures setup, we decided
      to try to run our machine, and found that it took several minutes to
      simply compile and create the model. This was extremely inefficient, and
      we realized that we were feeding too much data. To combat this, we lowered
      the number to around 500. When we did this, we still ran into a lot of
      trouble with runtime because we were still using way too much data.
      Additionally, due to there being a total of 6 classes our machine was not
      the most accurate which was frustrating to try to fix. We also ran into
      problems with the way numbers were being held up with fingers. Some people
      represent a number like three on their fingers in different ways, eg: hold
      up different fingers, rotate hands a different way, etc. It was very
      difficult to make our model accurately showcase this, which is something
      we need to improve on in the future. (UPDATE: We did this with our new
      model by including more varied images in our Final Project).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="heroText">
      After trial and error, we decided to reduce some complexity. We instead
      did 0-3 fingers to only make it 4 classes. This is so that our machine
      would be easier to train and simpler for users to use. Also, we found that
      the sweet spot for the number of data for the amount of classes we had was
      around 100 pictures. After we took these 100 pictures, we finally trained
      our model again and it ran efficiently and relatively accurately. Below is
      a picture of the class setup that we implemented. It is pretty simple, but
      we wanted to showcase the power of Teachable Machine and how it can
      quickly recognize different images, and we thought throwing up different
      numbers of fingers would accurately be able to represent that.
    </p>

    <p class="heroText">
      For our final iteration in this project, we made our model much more
      accurate, which is described on the next tab titled "Try our Model!".
      Essentially, we changed the data that was provided by going above 100 to
      around 400. We thought the sweet spot was 100 originally, but when testing
      with other people we found that our model wasn't accurate. In other words,
      with such little data, our model was effectively only working when we
      tried it ourselves. We made lots of improvements, and realized that data
      variance is important. Please feel free to read more!
