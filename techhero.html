      <!-- Content about our tech hero in paragraphs, used heroText css class for formatting-->
      <p class="heroText">
        Cadran Cowansage is a brilliant software engineer who is responsible for
        the creation of Elpha, a professional, venture backed network of
        high-achieving women in tech. Before taking on this endeavor, Cardan had
        a successful career in the tech industry. She earned a Bachelor's Degree
        from Colby college, majoring in computer science and biology. She then
        went on to earn her Master's Degree in Biomedical Informatics from
        Columbia. She began her tech career in 2012, working as a platform
        manager for Flatiron Health in New York City. After working at Flatiron
        for 5 months, Cadran went to work as a software engineer at MongoDB. She
        stayed at this position for just over two years before accepting a
        position as a tech lead for Y Combinator.
      </p>
      <!-- Break statements used throughout to give look of multiple different pargraphs-->
      <br />
      <p class="heroText">
        Cadran stayed with Y Combinator for three years before starting Elpha.
        At Elpha she served as the founder and CEO. Elpha was an extremely
        successful venture. At its peak, the company had more than 100,000
        members. Elpha was not your regular community. Its members found in it a
        truly accepting space where they could share their experiences in the
        industry and expect a plethora of professional support and advice from
        the extensive community of women in the tech industry. Cadran stepped
        down as the CEO of Elpha in January of 2025. She has also worked as a
        member of the technical staff at Open AI since 2023.
      </p>
      <br />
      <!--Next paragraph in description -->
      <p class="heroText">
        In addition to her work at Elpha, which was based on professional
        communication, Cadran is responsible for starting another online space
        for hybrid professional and social communication where the core culture
        and the product and software decisions were all set by women. This
        product is called Leap. Leap is a space for civil discourse and
        authentic conversations where users interact using their real
        identities. Cadran’s intent with Leap is for this discourse to help
        women in tech connect to other women in the tech space and through
        conversations and personal connections help propel women within the
        industry. Cadran started this social network after realizing that there
        was a lack of representation and connection between all of the smart and
        powerful women she knew who worked in tech. Using her extensive
        technical and social skills, Cadran has created both social and
        professional platforms providing women with connection, hope, and
        prosperity within the tech industry. She truly is a tech hero.
