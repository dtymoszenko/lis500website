    <h2 class="biasHeaders">Implicit Bias Definition</h2>
    <p class="biasDefinition">
      Implicit bias impacts how we perceive other people in ways we don’t
      consciously realize, often reinforcing harmful stereotypes and hurtful
      rhetoric. Implicit association tests (IAT”s) were developed in the late
      1990’s and have been used ever since to increase people's awareness of the
      unconscious impact their implicit biases have on their perceptions of
      different groups of people. Intersectionality expands on this awareness by
      highlighting the ways in which people's overlapping identities intersect
      to create unique instances of social oppression or advantage.
