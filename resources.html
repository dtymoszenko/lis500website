    <p class="biasDefinition">
      Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity
      in the world, in people, and in human experiences. The events and
      conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be
      understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many
      factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways. When it comes to social
      inequality, people's lives and the organization of power in a given
      society are better understood as being shaped not by a single axis of
      social division, be it race or gender or class, but my many axes that work
      together and influence each other. Intersectionality as an analytic tool
      gives people better access to the complexity of the world and of
      themselves.

      In other words, Intersectionality is a framework for understanding the
      complexities of human identities and how those complexities interact to
      influence social inequality, people's lives, and the organization of
      power.

    <h2 class="biasHeaders">Understanding Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p class="biasDefinition">
      Implicit bias impacts how we perceive other people in ways we don’t
      consciously realize, often reinforcing harmful stereotypes and rhetoric.
      Implicit association tests (IAT”s) were developed in the late 1990’s and
      have been used ever since to increase people's awareness of the
      unconscious impact their implicit biases have on their perceptions of
      different groups of people.

      Understanding How Implicit Bias and Intersectionality Interact
    </h2>
    <p class="biasDefinition">
      We all have implicit biases whether we realize it or not. But how do these
      implicit biases come about? And what do they tell us about ourselves and
      society as a whole? Implicit biases are a result of the social, economic,
      and political climates we were raised in. In addition to our environments,
      our implicit biases are also influenced by race, gender, ethnicity,
      culture, and other factors. Many of these factors were mentioned in
      Patricia and Sirma’s definition of intersectionality. The theory of
      intersectionality helps us to make sense of our implicit biases. But our
      implicit biases are not the direct result of factors like our race,
      gender, or economic status. They come from the culmination of all of the
      different aspects of our identities and the interactions between these
      aspects and the world around us. Ultimately, understanding where our
      implicit biases come from is the first step in expanding our awareness of
      our biases and addressing them. Intersectionality is an analytical tool
      that helps us reach this awareness by highlighting the ways in which
      people's overlapping identities intersect to create unique instances of
      social oppression or advantage.
    </p>
    <h2 class="biasHeaders">Our Findings</h2>
    <p class="biasDefinition">
      In our experience taking the Implicit Bias tests, we both reached
      eye-opening revelations about how our implicit biases manifest themselves.
      Cy was tested on his biases regarding disabled people. David took the
      tests for age and weight. In Cy’s experience, he was stunned to discover
      that he did have a bias against disabled people according to the American
      Bar Association’s Implicit Bias test. David discovered that he had a
      positive preference toward people who were younger and on the thinner
      side.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2 class="biasHeaders">
      How Can Our Understanding of Intersectionality and Implicit Biases Help Us
      To Make Sense Of Our Findings?
    </h2>
    <p class="biasDefinition">
      A good place to start is to decipher how the “Many axes that work together
      and influence each other” (Hill Collins, Bilge 2016) interacted to impact
      our Implicit biases. In Cy’s case, his upbringing in an able-bodied
      household interacting with his experience as an able-bodied person may
      have impacted his biases and apparent lack of empathy for disabled people.
      Similarly, David’s experience growing up in a household that was made up
      of generally thinner people and his own aptitude for physical fitness may
      have interacted to impact his weight implicit bias. His living in a
      college town surrounded by younger people and his own young age may have
      interacted to impact his implicit bias towards younger people. It is
      important to note that our implicit biases are not solely the result of
      two factors of our identities interacting. In accordance with the theory
      of intersectionality, our implicit biases are the result of a multitude of
      different aspects of our identities, societal, and environmental factors.
      The examples listed above are some of the most obvious factors. In reality
      the endeavor of understanding the roots of our implicit biases is an
      incredibly complex and multidimensional challenge. Regardless, our use of
      the theory of intersectionality gives us a better understanding of this
      challenge and provides a framework for better understanding our own
      identities and our relationship with the world around us.
