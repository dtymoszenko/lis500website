      As can be seen, our Teachable Machine is not quite perfect yet. There are
      still some problems with some overcompensation for the value 3, and it is
      a bit difficult to understand why. In our future checkpoints for this
      project, we hope to resolve this and make our model more accurate. For
      now, we are pleased with the progress we have made in efficiency and
      runtime, and it is interesting to see a decently accurate AI recognizing
      the amount of fingers we are holding up!

    <!-- New Update to project and how we got it to be more accurate.-->
    <h3>Update: Final Project</h3>
    <p class="heroText">
      Since the first checkpoint, we revised our machine learning model on
      Teachable Machine. Since we only used the images on teachable machine,
      they are not included in the GitHub. However, the update which we did was
      focused on including a more well-rounded database of pictures. Before,
      most of the pictures were stagnant and all of them included our space. We
      fixed this by holding up fingers from a varied distance, some including
      our face, and some not. This variance in a our data resulted in a much
      more accurate model, and we are proud of the improvement we made! Please
      look below to learn more!!
