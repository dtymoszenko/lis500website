      David is a senior studying Computer Science. He originally grew up in West
      Dundee, which is a very small town in Northern Illinois. He is fascinated
      by learning new ways to apply knowledge in the realm of Computer Science
      and has done two summer internships at different companies. However, he
      has taken many technical classes and is interested to learn about the more
      social side of his industry! He hopes that by taking this class he will
      have a better understanding of social issues in tech. He loves to read
      (his favorite book series is Stormlight Archive) and cook, and he recently
      has been training for his first marathon! It is in Milwaukee:

      Cy is a junior studying Information Science. He originally grew up in
      Minneapolis right next to the University of Minnesota. He enjoys doing fun
      activities and exploring the city of Minnesota. Here are some:

      >
      He decided to take LIS 500 because he had an interest in the less
      technical side of Computer Science. He is fascinated by having discussions
      with classmates about unique and interesting topics around the world. He
      thinks that this class will be valuable to learn from multiple
      perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of the people that he is
      working with.
